### Critical Loads

* The concept of critical loads was proposed as a way to evaluate the modeled loads across alternatives.

### Critical Loads

* However, when attempting to verify this relationship for purposes of this evaluation the relationship (based on available data) were not congruent with prior efforts (Janicki 2003) or were not consistent with temporal resolution of the models (Doering et al. 2006).
