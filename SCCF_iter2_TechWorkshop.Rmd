### Summary

Overall, a plan that provides a balanced approach across the system to maintain ecological integrity and function is needed. 

* All plans, *except DD*, keep lake stages higher relative to FWO.
  * AA & EEs have the highest number of days in extreme [high and low stages](#HiLoStg).

--

* CC and EEs provide the greatest number of optimum flow events for [CRE](#CREFlowCat).

--

* AA, CC and EEs provide the greatest number of low flow events for [SLE](#SLEFlowCat).
  * EE1 has highest frequency of damaging flow events for SLE.

--

* AA followed by CC and EEs provide the highest discharge volume south ([total annual](#EAAQ), [wet season](#EAAWet)) and late dry season ([*not shown*](#EAALateDry)).

--

* CC and EE plans are associated with optimal estuary flow events, flow south and % w/in the stage envelope based on [principal component analysis](#PCA2). 

--

* **PDT Question**: How much variability could we expect for EE plan(s) due to operational flexibility? 

???
**Lake Stage** EEs result in higher lake stage

**Lake Envelope** CC (and to some degree BB) provide a more balanced lake stage (relative to envelope) but not at the expense of other parts of the system

**Flows south** CC and EEs provide the highest discharge volume south but not at the expense of the Lake or Estuaries.
