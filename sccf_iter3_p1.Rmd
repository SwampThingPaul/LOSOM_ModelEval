### Iteration 3 Modeling

#### Phase 1
* Initial sensitivity runs based on Alternative CC & Iteration 3 goals
* Simplify release guidance and reduce dimensionality for optimization
* Test schedule components based on simplified schedule & Iteration 3 goals

#### Notes

Alternative Naming
* CC == CCTSP
* 2 versions of CCsimp4 - After simp4s1 (*Phase 1 - Test Flows to St Lucie Estuary*) was run it was renames as CCsimp4. Therefore in this presentation the second CCsimp4 was renamed to CCsimp4(2).

name: InitialSense


### Phase 1 - Initial Sensitivity Runs

* **S1:** Preserve opportunity to send water out of the lake for longer which addresses the goal of increasing flexibility in the lower portions of the schedule.

* **S2:** Regulate CRE releases by using flows at S-79 in all conditions in all zones except in Zone A

* **S3:** Reduce stress to CRE by incorporating friendly estuary release concepts from 4BC-1

* **S4:** Reduce stress to CRE by incorporating alternating estuary release concept from 4BC-2

* **S3-4:** Combination of friendly estuary release concepts and alternating estuary release concepts

* **S5:** Reduce stress to CRE by reducing maximum up to flows in Zone D

* **S6:** Combine zones B & C

* **S7:** Address algae by incorporating no releases to the Northern Estuaries in the months June –August except in Zone A

### Phase 1 - Test Schedule Components – CCR1

* CCR1 used CCsimp4 as base and incorporated features from smp4ZFSW, 271DS and ZB_S77

Evaluated: 

* Opportunities to reduce algal bloom risk in the northern estuaries (R1ABZD, R1ABZC, R1ABZB)

* Opportunities to improve lake health by incorporating extreme and moderate recovery operations (CCR1ED, CCR1MD1, CCRMD2)

* Opportunities to address water supply performance by modifying operations in lower portions of the schedule (R1WSEN, R1WSMF)

### Phase 1 - Inital Summary

* The alternative that reduces the number of extreme events (i.e. >6500 cfs at S79) the most is CC_S3 (from initial Sensitivity Runs) relative to [FWO (-41.4%)](#InitialSense1).
  * **S3:** Reduce stress to CRE by incorporating friendly estuary release concepts from 4BC-1

* Meanwhile, CC_S4 (from initial Sensitivity Runs) reduces the regulatory discharges to the Caloosahatchee the most relative to the [FWO (-34.8%)](#InitialSense2).
  * **S4:** Reduce stress to CRE by incorporating alternating estuary release concept from 4BC-2
  
* Other aspects need to be evaluated for sensitivity run suitability (i.e. increased optimal; reduce low, stress and damaging; Lake ecological envelope performance and; SLE/LWL salinity envelope performance)

* MCDA approach could can be used to screen sensitivity runs.
