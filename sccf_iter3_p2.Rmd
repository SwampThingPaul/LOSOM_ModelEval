### Iteration 3 Goals 

* Goals presented by USACE focused on water supply (tribal, LOSA and LECSA), estuary and lake health, and moving more water to the southern Everglades (see USACE Technical Stakeholder Engagement - 16-17 Sept 2021 meeting presentation).

* For purposes of this analysis we focused on:
  * *Reduce stress to the Caloosahatchee River and Estuary*
  * *Help Lake ecology by addressing the duration and number of events above 17 feet*
  
* Initially CC was used as the foundation (Phase 1 of Iteration 3)

* After the initial alternative sensitivity runs (i.e.  Iteration 3, Phase 1), alternative CCR1 was considered for the next phase of Iteration 3 to build *"CCR2B"*

### Iteration 3 - Run Screening

Using the RSM-BN Batch Runs spreadsheets (~240,000 runs)
.small[
* Runs were initially screened based on PM values relative to CC and NA25 (FWO)
  * Caloosahatchee optimal discharge (PM31)
  * Caloosahatchee stress discharge from LOK (PM37)
  * Caloosahatchee damaging discharge from LOK (PM38)
  * Caloosahatchee extreme discharge (PM36)
  * Percent LOK Stage >17 Ft NGVD29 (PM5)

* To narrow the data down, runs were subsetted based on PMs listed above relative to the CC value `r paste("\u00B1")` 5% (i.e. CC PM31 + 5%, CC PM37 - 5%, etc) than sorted and the 1st eight of each batch were retained 
]


*Example R Code*
```
b1.screen<-subset(dat,
                 PM31>CC.val$PM31*1.05&
                   PM37<CC.val$PM37*0.95&
                   PM38<CC.val$PM38*0.95&
                   PM36<CC.val$PM36*0.95&
                   PM5<CC.val$PM5*0.95&
                   batch==1)
b1.screen<-b1.screen[order(-b1.screen$PM31,b1.screen$PM37,
                           b1.screen$PM38,b1.screen$PM36,
                           b1.screen$PM5),]

### Iteration 3 - Phase 2

* This is an initial look at the batch results and expect our evaluation to evolve with greater understanding.

* There appears to be several plans where we can balance the needs of system without adversely impacted other parts of the system.
