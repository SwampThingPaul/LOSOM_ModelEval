### The Good

* Estuaries: `r paste("\u21E7")` optimal flow & `r paste("\u21E9")` stress and damaging flow

* Everglades: `r paste("\u21E7")` flow south (via S351 & S354) 

--

### The Bad

* Estuaries: `r paste("\u21E7")` extreme flow events 

* Lake Okeechobee: `r paste("\u21E7")` high stage (17 & 16 Ft NGVD metrics)

* Lake Okeechobee: `r paste("\u21E7")` in stage envelope scores (+36% difference to FWO)

--

### The Ugly

* Proposed 1.5 Ft WSM buffer

class: extreme

### Extreme event - Recommendation

* While reduced LOK derived stressful and damaging flow events is good minimizing LOK derived extreme events for CRE is recommended.

--

* Extreme events (regardless of source) can adversely impact estuary and near shore environment.
  * nutrient transport, high color, prolonged freshwater conditions in estuary, etc.

--

* Large discharges can alter circulation patterns in lower estuary such that Gulf water is drawn into estuary through barrier islands' main inlets which can draw in and concentration *K. brevis* (if present) from Gulf rather than flush it out (Dye et al 2020 & Olabarrieta et al *In Prep*).

### Application of Hydrologic Restoration Goals for a Large Subtropical Lake *(In Prep.)*

.pull-left[
Based on methodology of Havens (2002). 

Lake stage is a major driver in Lake ecology (see Conceptual Ecological Model).
.small[
* Extreme high lake stage (>5.2 m/17 Ft NGVD29)

* Moderate high lake stage (>4.9 m/16 Ft NGVD29) > 90 days

* Moderate low lake stage (<3.3 m/11 Ft NGVD29) > 90 days

* Extreme low lake stage (<3.0 m/10 Ft NGVD29)

* Spring/SNKI nest period recession
  * March 1 - June 15
  * weekly recession rate between -0.05 and 0.05 Ft/wk (0.02 m/wk) for more than 1/4th of nesting period.

* Events per decade

* PA25 has higher Extreme & Moderate high stage events .small[(see Extreme Event Analysis [slide](#LOK3))] lowering the score.

* LOSOM is not a restoration plan but should take into account ecology of the system. 

* Benefits to other parts of the system is balanced on the back of the Lake.

### Low lake stage management

* Last PDT meeting SFWMD stated 

.content-box-gray[the state *“is asking for explicit reliance 
on the District to guide operational decisions when Lake stages 
are at or below 1.5 feet above the Water Shortage Management Band.”*]

### Low lake stage management

* The WSM buffer would effectively create a new management band in the schedule. 

--

* This new concept is not included in the current modeling.

--

* Represents up to 520 - 591 kAc-Ft of water that could be moved around (or withheld from the estuaries and Everglades).
  * based on [stage-volume relationship](#stage_vol).
  * *Zone D3 to S79<sup>1</sup> (`r paste("\u2264")` 350 cfs)* a small fraction of total available volume in buffer .small[([How it was modeled](#LOSOMProcess))].

.footnote[
.small[
<sup>1</sup> Release LOK water at S77 such that the LOK will not cause S79 flow to exceed this target; local runoff can still cause flow higher than this value at S79.
]
]

--

* In current modeling, Lake stage is within the proposed WSM buffer ~22% of time for both preferred alternatives (during period of simulation)
  * Conversely, Lake stage is within Zone D3 ~ 29% of the time for both preferred alternatives (during period of simulation).

* Joint letter on behalf of Friends of the Everglades, Calusa Waterkeeper, Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation, Florida Oceanographic and Conservancy of Southwest Florida sent to Col. Booth ([link](https://sccf-tech.github.io/slides/LOSOM/LOSOMLetters/LOSOM letter Jan 21 2022_FINAL.pdf) to letter).
